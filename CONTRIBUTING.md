# Contributing to Hacking Exposed

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

-   Reporting a bug
-   Discussing the current state of the labs
-   Submitting a fix
-   Proposing new labs

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2.  Make your improvment or fix.
3.  Make sure your contribution has proper formating.
4.  Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA) License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ryru/HackingExposed/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ryru/HackingExposed/issues/new); it's that easy!

Small typos and fixes don't need an Issue, simply correct them and submit a Pull Request!
